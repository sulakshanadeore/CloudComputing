Introduction to Cloud Computing  and Cloud Services
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Cloud Computing?
Computing on the cloud.

It is giving/delivering services such as servers, storage,databases,networking, intelligence, analytics  over the cloud(internet).

Cloud computing is an alternative to "on-premises data center", where the company has to manage everything, such as
purchasing and installing hardware, virtualization,security, os , and any other network configurations, manpower required for it, and 
if required go on upgrading when required.


Two types of cloud:
Private: a company owns it and uses it for itself.
It gives more security but the cost is very high, its 24*7 available for ourselves only.
All management is done by cloud company.(manage everything, such as
purchasing and installing hardware, virtualization,security, os , and any other network configurations, manpower required for it, and 
if required go on upgrading when required).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Public: when many companies share a cloud its called public cloud.
It get security, but there may a very negligible  chance of security breach.
but the cost is very less as compared to a private cloud, and its available 24*7.
manage everything, such as
purchasing and installing hardware, virtualization,security, os , and any other network configurations, manpower required for it, and 
if required go on upgrading when required.

Hybrid Cloud: Combination of Private  and Public, whihc allows data apps to be shared between businesses.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Servers and Networking:  Infrastructure as a Service
Storage :  Infrastructure as a Service
Software/Platform : Software as a Service 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What are Cloud Service Provider?
Some of them are:
Azure---Microsoft
Amazon Web Services--- Amazon
Google Cloud Service---- Google
Alibaba Cloud----Alibaba
Oracle Cloud--Oracle
IBM Cloud--IBM


It is company or CSP(cloud service proivider) that provides on-demand scalable computing resources like computing power,
data storage, appls, networking services over the internet.

Advanatages:
1) Reduced costs
2) Scalability
3) Reliabilty
4) Centralised location
5) Business Agile

Disadvantages:
1) Complex Contracts: SLA(Service level Agreement)--What is provided , what is not provided and in what circumstances.
2)Security Responsibility: security to be implemented on both ends must be undertood in the agreement.

How to choose the service provider factors:
1) cost
2) services
3) security
4) digital capability and processes
5) trust
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Terminologies in Azure:
1) Resource: Any entity manage by Azure for ex: VM, storage Account or Virtual Network.
2) Subscription: A logical container for resources, each resource is associated/tied up , and their subscription.
3) Resource Group: A group of resources are related and can clubbed together.
4) Management Group: A logical container for multiple subscriptions   used together 
5)Azure AD(Active Directory): Identity and Access Management(Authorization and Authentication) management services controlling access to resources.
6) Azure AD Tenant: A dedicated and a trusted instance of Azure AD, representing a single organisation.

Deployment and Management
1) ARM(Azure Resource Manager): A deployment model for creating and managing resources through templates
2) ARM templates: Json files used to define infrastructure as code for deployment
3) Azure CLI: A command line interface for managing Azure services
4) Azure Powershell: A scripting language for managing and automating Azure services
5) Virtual Network: A network which allows different resources to communicate privately
6) Azure Blueprints: deploying and managing repeating infrastructure configurations
7) Subnet: A range of ip addresses within the virtual network
8)Azure Policy: Resource compliance for creating and enforcing policies on the users of the account
9)Azure Advisor: A service that provides recommendation for optimization of Azure services.

Resource and ResourceGroup:
Website/Webapp, a database and storage account.
Resources:
1) A web server for hosting the website/webapp
2)  A database for storing the data of the app
3) a storage account for storing the app related data like audios,videos,image files etc

Resource group of the above resources.

Subscription: cost of the resources.
Management Group: hierarchical structure for managing multiple subscriptions,policies and access control.

PDTGroup:
Production: limited access
Development :full access
Testing: limited access


PRGroup:
Production:full access
Reporting:full access

Which group can access data from which region, decided in the management group policy.

IaM(Identity and Management) : Which resource group will have what level of  access will be decided by the Identity and Management of Azure Active Directory services.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Availability Sets and Availability Zones:
Availability is about the servers--database, application and storage.
To keep it up and running we need copies of it in different zones and copies of it.

Availability Zone: Where it is stored
Availability Sets: How many copies of it to be created 

AZ and AS depend on the pricing model.

AZ(Availability zones) are geographically isolated data centers within a cloud region, each having its own independent power, cooling and networking infrastructure.
AZ's are designed to be resilient to failures in one zone by ensuring that if a zone goes down, other remains operational, supporting regional services and capacity.

Features of AZ:
1) Isolation: physically and logically separated to minimise the impact of failure in one zone on others.
2) Redundancy: Multiple AZ's within a region provide redundancy(repeatation) ensuring apps continue to operate even if one zone experiences a problem.
3)Low Latency Connectivity: AZ's are connected via low-latency networks,allowing efficient replication and failover.
4) Disaster Recovery: Protection of apps and data from data center failures.
5) High Availability: because of distributed resources across multiple zones, apps maintain high availability and reliability.


In Azure, Locally Redundant Storage(LRS):
It copies data synchronously 3 times within a single data center in the primary key.
It provides protection against server rack and drive failures, but is susceptible to data center failures like fire and floods
This is the least expensive redundancy option and is not suggested for apps that need high availability or durability.
It is suitable for scenarios where local data center availability is sufficient and cost is primary concern.

ZRS---Zone Redundant Storage----
It copies data synchronously across 3 AZ within primary regions.
It has high availability than LRS as it protects against zone failures.
It expensive than LRS but is a good choice for apps that need high availability or durability within a region.

GRS-----Geo Redundant Storage
It copies data synchronously across 3 AZ within primary regions and async replicates it to the secondary region using LRS.
High availability and durability.
More expensive than ZRS, offers protection against disaster, has highest level of protection for disaster recovery.

RA-GRS----Read Access GRS--- GRS + copies of data stored in paired azure regions.
99.99% read operation increases in SLA(Service Level Agreement)

Object Replication for Block BLOB(Binary Large objects):
This is specially available for only BLOB Storage. It has async replication storage, automatically can move data to archives.
