Introduction to Cloud Computing  and Cloud Services
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Cloud Computing?
Computing on the cloud.

It is giving/delivering services such as servers, storage,databases,networking, intelligence, analytics  over the cloud(internet).

Cloud computing is an alternative to "on-premises data center", where the company has to manage everything, such as
purchasing and installing hardware, virtualization,security, os , and any other network configurations, manpower required for it, and 
if required go on upgrading when required.


Two types of cloud:
Private: a company owns it and uses it for itself.
It gives more security but the cost is very high, its 24*7 available for ourselves only.
All management is done by cloud company.(manage everything, such as
purchasing and installing hardware, virtualization,security, os , and any other network configurations, manpower required for it, and 
if required go on upgrading when required).

Public: when many companies share a cloud its called public cloud.
It get security, but there may a very negligible  chance of security breach.
but the cost is very less as compared to a private cloud, and its available 24*7.
manage everything, such as
purchasing and installing hardware, virtualization,security, os , and any other network configurations, manpower required for it, and 
if required go on upgrading when required.
